1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,500
wow what an audience but if I'm being honest 

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,100
I don't care what you think of my talk 

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,500
I don't care what the internet thinks my talk 

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,500
cuz they're the ones who get it seen and 

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,400
get a shirt and I think that's where most 

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,000
people get it wrong you're talking to you here 

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,700
instead of talking to you random person scrolling Facebook 

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,900
thanks for the click you see back in 2009 

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,800
we all have these weird little things called attention 

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,300
spans yeah I'm trying to think of the last 

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,600
time I watched an 18-minute tedtalk been years literally 

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,900
years so if you're given a TED Talk keep 

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,900
it quick I'm doing mine and under a minute 

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,500
I'm at 44 seconds right now that means you 

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,000
got time for one final joke why are balloons 

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,100
so expensive 

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,500
inflation
